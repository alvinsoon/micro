I was discharged a day later, fazed but grateful.\n\nA week passed.\n\nAnd then, on another ordinary Saturday, my son and I built the starfighter.\n\nI handled the instructions and nudged the bricks into place. He sat beside me, snapping on bits and pieces. He was restless, as any toddler would be, but every time I asked if he wanted to stop, he said no. He wanted to keep going. So did I.\n\nNow the finished starfighter sits on a shelf in the living room, pointed towards the window, catching sunlight on its wings. Outside, the birds are singing. Inside, I hear the two of you laughing.\n",
