			 <h3 id="before">Before</h3>
<p>There once was a city filled with clocks.</p>
<p>They stood on rooftops and road junctions; they hung in bakeries where bread cooled on wooden racks. The clocks were all in agreement. They told people when to wake, when to work, when to hurry, when to rest, so that not a minute was wasted.</p>
<p>At 9:41 on a Tuesday morning, a child was born. She didn’t cry when the clocks expected her to. She laughed when silence was scheduled. She slept through bells and woke before they chimed.</p>
<p>Her parents worried. Her teachers worried. Everyone else treated her like a crack on a plate – best avoided lest it spread.</p>
<p>But she loved the city. She loved the way the birds sang at the same time every morning. She loved how the baker gave her a taste of the freshest loaves, right out of the ovens. She loved sitting underneath the great clock in the town square, listening to its deep, constant ticking.</p>
<h3 id="after">After</h3>
<p>Then the storm came.</p>
<p>Rain fell up instead of down; and lightning struck not at buildings, but in the spaces between seconds.</p>
<p>The great clock rang one last time – and went silent.</p>
<p>When the storm passed, the clocks were all out of order. Some slowed, some quickened, and some stopped altogether. The people emerged, dazed. Buses came late, or not at all. Bread burned in ovens. An old woman stood in the town square, trying to count the moments and failing.</p>
<h3 id="while">While</h3>
<p>Beneath the great clock, something stirred.</p>
<p>Long ago, when the city was young and its people frightened of uncertainty, they had built the Chronovore out of gears and crystals. The giant, now rusted with age, groaned as it awakened, and a door opened in its great chest.</p>
<p>The people remembered what it required.</p>
<p>A living core.</p>
<p>They looked at the girl.</p>
<p><em>She had always been out of step,</em> they whispered. <em>Too early. Too late. (Maybe this had provoked the storm.)</em></p>
<p>They led her beneath the city to the Chronovore. They explained to her that if she joined with it, the city would become whole again. But there would be a price: she would never change. She would be constant, eternal.</p>
<p>She hesitated. Above, the city was failing. She’d heard the cries of babies whose mothers didn’t know when to feed them. She knew the trains no longer ran.</p>
<p>She stepped inside the Chronovore, and it closed behind her. Wires of brass and silver wrapped themselves around her wrists. The great clock gasped, and the city’s clocks restarted themselves. Bells rang in harmony. The people knew when they were again.</p>
<h3 id="when">When</h3>
<p>It was quiet inside the machine.</p>
<p>The girl felt her breath soften and her shoulders loosen. For the first time, she didn’t feel like she was arriving too early or leaving too late.</p>
<p>She realised: <em>this is what they feel like.</em></p>
<p>She thought about what it would feel like to stay here. To grow older without being watched. Without apologising. Without being wrong all the time.</p>
<p>The thought brought her comfort.</p>
<p>She waited.</p>
<p>As time passed, she noticed something small. A thinning. As if the space between moments had grown narrow, leaving no room to push, to wonder, to change her mind.</p>
<p>Above her, the city breathed deeply.</p>
<p>A doubt arose in her mind, and it caused a tremor through the city. She lifted a finger, just to see if she still could, and the city’s clocks skipped a beat.</p>
<p>“Please,” the people said. “Stay.”</p>
<p>The Chronovore didn’t speak. It only held her more closely.</p>
<p>The girl remembered running to get a slice of bread, not because it was planned, but <em>because</em> it wasn’t. She remembered laughing at her little sister’s babbling, even when it was the quiet hour. She remembered how it felt to dance to birdsong when the moment, not the clock, moved her.</p>
<p>She slipped her wrists free and stepped out of the machine.</p>
<p>Bells rang unevenly throughout the city. Clocks stuttered. The ground shook. Bridges swayed. People ran, calling for the time.</p>
<p>The Chronovore shuddered and fell back into itself, unfinished. It sighed, then returned to sleep and waiting.</p>
<p>The girl walked out. She walked past the great clock, silent and cold. She walked past the bakery, shuttered and closed. She walked past the school, quiet without classes. And she walked until the city of clocks was a shadow on the horizon.</p>
<h3 id="then">Then</h3>
<p>Some people learned to live – in time. Bread burned, until the bakers learnt how to watch it instead of the clock. Children knew when to go home by the fading sun. Some clocks were taken down and turned into other things. Some were left where they’d fallen.</p>
<p>And sometimes, when a meeting failed to happen, or a train arrived too early or too late, someone would say that once, the city almost became perfect again.</p>
<p>Almost.</p>

			 <p>They say you cannot cross the same Shatun twice.</p>
<p>The land was treacherous and mercurial. It did not hold still. Hills sank in a day. Rivers rose where desert was. You could fall asleep in a lush oasis and wake among stones that remembered the ocean.</p>
<p>Most travellers went the long way around, even if it took weeks. Crossing Shatun took days – if you survived.</p>
<p>I crossed because I was commanded. “There is no known map,” the king said. “But you must arrive.” Kings are fond of straight lines.</p>
<p>At the border, I met Chang, a Shatun warden.  They lived at the edges of the land, watching it, charging dearly, promising nothing. When I asked if he knew the way, he only kept silent.</p>
<p>We prayed before the crossing. I looked back one last time at civilisation – its houses bright, untroubled – and followed him into the blur.</p>
<h3 id="where-the-ground-forgets">Where the ground forgets</h3>
<p>The land shifted around us like a changing mind. Green grass turned into black sand, cherry trees bloomed against snow walls, sunlight broke through the sudden sleet. Whenever I turned, the ground behind us was already changed, our footprints erased, the land refusing them.</p>
<p>Looking ahead was no help. The horizon dissolved, hidden by fog, glare, or drifting sand.</p>
<p>Chang walked ahead, then stopped. The earth beneath us softened and began to slide.</p>
<p>“Which way?” I asked.</p>
<p>He did not answer.</p>
<p>I stepped forward, uncertain. The ground held. Chang followed.</p>
<p>I don’t know how Chang found his bearings in this inconstant land. Sometimes he strode forward with certainty. Sometimes he tested the ground with small, careful steps. Sometimes he stopped altogether, staff planted, waiting.</p>
<p>I remembered stories then, of men who’d entered Shatun and were found centuries later, unmarked by time, still searching for home.</p>
<p>“Is it true?” I asked.</p>
<p>Chang waited. I stepped forward. He nodded.</p>
<p>That first night, the land offered us a clearing. We made a small fire. Though it had only been a day, my head swam, as if part of me lagged a step behind the rest. For a moment, I wondered if we’d already crossed into the spirit lands.</p>
<p>Chang pressed a bowl of hot porridge into my hands.</p>
<p>“Eat,” he said. “It will bring you back to yourself.”</p>
<p>Rainbows across the night sky, unmoored from rain or sun, dancing to an unheard melody.</p>
<h3 id="paying-the-price">Paying the price</h3>
<p>On the third day, we crossed a swamp that hardened into stone. Chang stopped so suddenly that I nearly collided with him. He drove his staff into the ground as if anchoring himself into the earth.</p>
<p>Wolves emerged from the fog. Two, then more, until there were six. They were enormous, their outlines constantly shifting. They did not step as much as ripple across the terrain.</p>
<p>The wolves advanced.</p>
<p>Chang did not move.</p>
<p>The ground rumbled. The wolves came closer.</p>
<p>No sign. No instruction.</p>
<p>I stepped forward and planted my feet, forcing my shivering hands into fists.</p>
<p>The wolves stopped.</p>
<p>The lead wolf lowered its head, its gaze fixed not on Chang, but on me. Its eyes hollows of dark water. I felt pressure then. Not malice, but attention. As if something were being weighed.</p>
<p>Something loosened inside me. There was no pain, only a brief sense that something small but important had been lifted away.</p>
<p>Then the wolves flowed back.</p>
<p>One by one, they withdrew, slipping into the fog without sound. The lead wolf lingered last. It looked at Chang, then at me, as if to mark us. Then it turned and was gone.</p>
<p>My legs gave way. I collapsed to the ground, shaking. Chang knelt beside me and held out his canteen. His hand trembled once before it steadied.</p>
<p>“They are done,” he said.</p>
<p>I drank. The water tasted metallic.</p>
<p>“What did they want?” I asked.</p>
<p>Chang stood. “Balance,” he said. Then, after a pause, “And payment.”</p>
<p>We made camp early that day.</p>
<h3 id="the-pathless">The pathless</h3>
<p>On the fifth morning, the horizon returned. Flat green fields stretched outward, the sky so close it seemed within reach, the sun warm on my fingers.</p>
<p>“This is where we part,” Chang said.</p>
<p>I bowed. “How did you know the way? I never saw a path.”</p>
<p>Chang smiled then, just the once. “There was no path,” he said. “Only walking.”</p>
<p>He turned and walked back toward Shatun, his figure dissolving into the mist.</p>
<p>I chose a direction and began.</p>
<p><em>This story is inspired by Antonio Machado’s poem “Proverbios y cantares (XXIX)”, often translated as “Traveller, there is no path.”</em></p>

			 <p>I came to Buddhism out of pain. I hoped it might offer a way out of the daily thrum of dissatisfaction and into something like happiness — or at least the assurance that everything would eventually be all right.</p>
<p>It didn’t.</p>
<p>Buddhism, as it turns out, was unflinching. It said that everything and everyone you love, including your own life, is impermanent, and that we live in a world that can’t reliably satisfy. I appreciated the honesty.</p>
<p>What Buddhism doesn’t promise is the end of pain. What it points to instead is the possibility that pain need not always become suffering. Even the Buddha, tradition reminds us, lived with chronic back pain.</p>
<p>Still, I dived in with hope. I believed that practice might lead to attainments: stream-entry, awakening, the wisdom and bliss that seemed possible if I devoted myself fully to the path. And eventually enlightenment, whatever that might be.</p>
<p>But the practice refused to unfold as I had expected. Happiness didn’t arrive. The <em>jhanas</em> — those otherworldly states described in books — didn’t appear. My attention remained a dutiful wanderer. Years passed. The thought <em>maybe I’m doing this wrong</em> arose. <em>Maybe I’m wasting my time.</em></p>
<p>I eventually let go of those hopes at a moment when serious practice no longer seemed possible. I don’t mistake this choice for completion. It’s a trade I’m willing to live with, for now. Letting go brought a clarity of its own. It also brought heartache.</p>
<p>Then, a year ago, <a href="https://alvinsoon.com/2025/04/11/the-starfighter.html">I found myself in the Intensive Care Unit</a>. My heart was racing uncontrollably. No one knew why yet. I didn’t know if I would make it home to see my children again. The machines beside me hummed and pinged, indifferent to the person they were connected to.</p>
<p>Fear arose. And yet panic didn’t take over. Attention returned to the breath, to sensations in the body, to the simple fact of being there, moment by moment. Calm appeared. It didn’t erase fear, but it kept fear from growing.</p>
<p>Only later did I recognise that something had shifted over the years, so slowly I’d barely noticed. I used to be hot-tempered, easily flustered, and impatient. That’s not how people tend to describe me now. It wasn’t a breakthrough I experienced as it happened, but something I recognised only in hindsight. A slow erosion.</p>
<p>There were places the practice didn’t reach. Meditation didn’t lift me out of depression, no matter how hard I tried. Therapy did. This taught me something important: Buddhism didn’t have to carry everything.</p>
<p>What it did teach me was to see suffering less as a personal failure than as the result of causes and conditions — not as an excuse, but as a way of loosening blame and extending kindness, toward myself and others.</p>
<p>Over time, that understanding shaped my actions. The precepts (training rules kept imperfectly but repeatedly returned to) kept me from justifying harm in the name of selfish pleasure. Restraint didn’t make me virtuous. It gave me fewer excuses.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I would have learned these things elsewhere. Buddhism doesn’t protect me, or the people I love, from time, illness, or death. It doesn’t resolve every tension. What it offers instead is a way to stand my ground when the ground falls away: not turning aside when things don’t go my way, paying with presence, being kind where I can, and doing the least harm where I cannot.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m a Buddhist.</p>

			 <p>There is an old story. Sen no Rikyū, the Japanese tea master, was invited to tea by a man who owned a prized caddy made of a special pattern. But Rikyū didn’t take much notice of the caddy and left without comment. The owner was so upset that he smashed the caddy to pieces.</p>
<p>A friend collected the broken pieces and carefully glued them together. He later invited Rikyū to tea and used the mended caddy.</p>
<p>Rikyū spotted the caddy immediately. “Is this not the same caddy I saw elsewhere some time ago?” Rikyū said. “When it is repaired like this, it has really turned into a piece of <em>wabi</em>.” The friend was pleased and returned the caddy to its former owner.</p>
<p>Things fall apart. And we spend much of our lives trying to keep things from falling apart. The Japanese speak of <em>wabi</em> (austere beauty) and <em>sabi</em> (rustic patina): finding beauty in imperfection and impermanence. A way of noticing what happens when things are changed by time. When they no longer pretend to be perfect.</p>
<p>Another story. When Rikyū was still an apprentice, his master told him to sweep the court – after the master had already swept it clean. Rikyū shook a tree, letting a few leaves fall on the ground.</p>
<p>The problem with telling a story is that it has to wrap neatly; otherwise, it wouldn’t make a good story. Life rarely allows such neat corrections.</p>
<p>My essays may make it sound like my life resolved more cleanly than it ever did. In truth, it more closely resembled constant breaking and mending. And some broken things could not be mended. They still had to be carried.</p>
<p>At times, beauty has appeared too, though it never removed the cracks. It appeared in the patina of weather, age, and austerity. It didn’t make what was broken whole again. But it did reveal something truer.</p>
<p>Some days, nothing felt mended, and everything looked like a crack. I showered, attended meetings, told stories to my children, and kept going anyway.</p>
<p>One last story. Rikyū was and is considered a master among masters. When he was in his seventies, Rikyū incurred the wrath of his master, the feudal lord Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and was ordered to commit suicide. He made his final tea, then wrote his farewell verse.</p>
<p><em>The stories of Sen no Rikyū are drawn from</em> Zen and Japanese Culture <em>by D. T. Suzuki.</em></p>

			 <p>I’ve never been to France, but someone once saw me there.</p>
<p>A friend was looking at a photo of a young man standing in the streets of Paris, wearing a long coat, hair blowing in the wind. “When were you in France?” he asked.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t me. He was looking at a photo of my father, who’d gone to France as an engineer. We have the same high forehead, the same downward-sloping eyes, the same sharp nose. If not for the age of the photo, it could have been a photograph of me.</p>
<p>For a moment, I felt something – pride, connection, but also a strange lightness, as if my edges had blurred.</p>
<p>My father was born in the year of the tiger. To me, he’s always been one: fierce, self-directed, moving through life in decisive strides. Even now, as age has slowed his pace, I still glimpse the tiger pacing inside him.</p>
<p>His life didn’t unfold the way he’d imagined. There were risks that didn’t pay off, ambitions that narrowed rather than expanded. Still, there’s something in the way he stayed upright through it all – doing whatever it took to keep our family going, insisting on living life on his own terms.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to understand what that kind of strength costs in return. A shield that protects, but also isolates.</p>
<p>Somewhere in my thirties, my face began to change. It softened. Rounded. The resemblance shifted. I started to see my mother in the mirror.</p>
<p>She was born in the year of the rabbit, and she carries that gentleness. Where my father is forceful, she is giving. She doesn’t announce her love; she shows it. Even now, with her hair fully grey, she insists on cooking whenever we gather. She’s given so much, I wish she’d take more for herself.</p>
<p>For years, I saw my parents as giants. It took time to see them as people, capable of great love and tenderness, but also fear and worry. They’ve inspired me, frustrated me, let me down, and cared for me when I couldn’t care for myself. They have loved imperfectly. I’ve tried, imperfectly, to love them back.</p>
<p>My son was born in the year of the tiger, like his grandfather, and in the same month I was born. My daughter was born in the year of the rabbit, like her grandmother, and in the same month as her mother. Their birthdays fall on consecutive days: the eighteenth and the nineteenth. Patterns. Parallels. Unplanned.</p>
<p>When my son runs into the world, eager and unafraid, I see the tiger reflected. When my daughter leans into me, calm and trusting, I feel the rabbit’s warmth all over again.</p>
<p>I look in the mirror and still see the tiger and the rabbit looking back at me. But now I also sense them moving ahead of me, carrying forward, with a little bit of us and a lot of themselves. I don’t know yet what they’ll make of their inheritance. I’m still learning how to live with it myself.</p>
<p>I wonder what someone else might see, years from now, leafing through a photograph.</p>

			 <p>I used to think prayer was about belief: either you believed, or you did not, and that was that.</p>
<p>I no longer think this is true.</p>
<p>I think prayer is less about conviction than about posture: how one stands in relation to what one can’t control.</p>
<p>I used to read to understand. But lately, I’ve found myself reading to travel – to go beyond my imagination; to go beyond myself. It’s become something closer to prayer – not for answers, but for mystery.</p>
<h4 id="the-magic-of-vajrayana-by-ken-mcleod">The Magic of Vajrayana by Ken McLeod</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>And just as I have done for decades, I go to the edge of the world as I know it and reach out. That, for me, is the essence of prayer: to go to the edge of what I know and reach out to the unknown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d resisted prayer for a long time; likely fallout from leaving the church. What use could prayer have in a rational life? But this sentence in <em>The Magic of Vajrayana</em> shook me. Perhaps prayer isn’t about supplication, but about reaching out beyond the limits of what I can know.</p>
<p>And so, for the better part of the year, I’ve started my mornings with a quiet prayer from the book: <em>Buddhas and bodhisattvas, wherever you are, please help me find a way.</em></p>
<h4 id="things-become-other-things-by-craig-mod">Things Become Other Things by Craig Mod</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>You may get the gist, but it’s only by witnessing it, again and again, that you believe it. You really believe it’s as simple as: kindness, curiosity, generosity. <em>Yoyū</em>. Just a bit of goddamned <em>yoyū</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Find a way to what? Like Craig Mod, who walked his way out of scarcity of spirit and into generosity, I was trying to find the same. A way to live that would create what the Japanese call <em>yoyū</em>: “the excess provided when surrounded by a generous abundance.”</p>
<p>Mod embodied this in his friend and mentor, John, someone who could raise “the station of all he spoke with in the way he spoke&hellip; A state made possible by boundless <em>yoyū</em>.”</p>
<h4 id="opening-the-hand-of-thought-by-kosho-uchiyama-roshi">Opening the Hand of Thought by Kosho Uchiyama Roshi</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Since life is always potential, whether you are a violet or a rose simply is not something that is fixed, nor is it necessary to try to figure it out. What is vital here is that you give expression to the flower of your Self, the flower of here and now, and allow it to blossom as completely and as naturally as it can in every moment of your life. That flower of your Self, that flower of here and now, is your life!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine Uchiyama Roshi saying the way to <em>yoyū</em> would be to live – <em>just live</em>. To pour your whole heart into this present moment, whether it’s joyous, heartbreaking or bland, and be here wholeheartedly.</p>
<h4 id="moonbound-by-robin-sloan">Moonbound by Robin Sloan</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t despair!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is easy to say, but difficult to do – and that’s why we have stories. Stories of people like you and me, completely ordinary, who get put through the wringer, and still find a way not to despair. Stories to help us imagine optimistic tomorrows, so we can reach for them, making real what can be imagined.</p>
<p>Some days, when I do despair, I pray. And I think: if <em>Moonbound</em>’s Ariel could do it, perhaps I can too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It was all too difficult,” said the warrior. “Everything I ever did. But it got done.” She eyed him sharply, but not unkindly. “Ariel. Get it done.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I no longer think prayer is a matter of belief. I think it is a matter of care. Some days, that care takes the form of a prayer, other days, of a walk, and sometimes, of a story.</p>

			 <p>Most people think happiness is something you can get. If you reach for it hard enough – through habits, purchases, routines – it’ll eventually land in your hands.</p>
<p>I believed that. When it didn’t work, I reached a different conclusion: happiness must not be very important.</p>
<p>Both ideas failed me.</p>
<p>For a long time, I treated happiness as proof. If I were living right – eating well, exercising, meditating – then happiness should appear as a reward. When it didn’t, I assumed I was failing the process. I took cold showers, fasted, journaled. The rituals multiplied. The results didn’t.</p>
<p>What hit wasn’t the absence of happiness so much as the blame that filled it. Our culture treats happiness as a promise: if you optimise correctly, you should feel good. But it also comes as a test: if you don’t, the fault is yours. Happiness is marketed as a birthright, but only for those who follow the ‘right’ protocols.</p>
<p>Eventually, exhausted by chasing a feeling that never seemed to arrive, I swung in the opposite direction. I told myself the pursuit of happiness was superficial. That a serious life was built on sturdier things: meaning, responsibility, endurance. I had a family, work, obligations. Happiness, I decided, was optional.</p>
<p>This belief was easier to live with. It gave me reasons (commitment, growth, duty) to explain why feeling flat didn’t matter. But it also came with a cost.</p>
<h3 id="what-passed-through">What passed through</h3>
<p>When my son was one, my spouse and I argued – rare in our sixteen years together. I had been spiralling for weeks, sleep-deprived and withdrawn, convinced I could muscle my way through a low period if I stayed stoic enough. I hadn’t noticed how brittle I’d become until I cracked that afternoon.</p>
<p>As we sparred and cried, our son stood in his playpen, gripping the bars. He let go, fell, laughed, and tried again. The moment should have interrupted us. Instead, it passed right through.</p>
<p>Later, I realised there had been happiness in that room, and I had been unavailable to it.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of a different way of thinking.</p>
<p>What if happiness isn’t something you achieve or denounce, but something that depends on care? Care in the ordinary way we tend to anything alive. Rest. Attention. Kindness. None of these guarantees happiness. But neglect them long enough, and happiness becomes unlikely.</p>
<p>Seen this way, happiness resembles health more than wealth. It can’t be reduced to a single metric. You can excel in one area and struggle in another. You can feel fine one day, be off the next, and still be healthy. The more useful question becomes not “Am I happy?” but “What do I need to tend?”</p>
<h3 id="grace-not-guarantees">Grace, not guarantees</h3>
<p>Another afternoon, I took my son to a neighbourhood playground. Nothing out of the ordinary, the equipment was rusty, the weather unremarkable. Watching him play, I felt a brief, expansive vividness: a sense of well-being that arrived without effort or explanation.</p>
<p>It didn’t feel earned. It didn’t correspond to any insight or improvement. Happiness appeared neither when I chased it nor when I dismissed it, but when the conditions happened – almost accidentally – to be right.</p>
<p>Psychologist Shigehiro Oishi argues that a flourishing life consists not only of happiness, but also of meaning and psychological richness. The unsettling implication is that the three don’t necessarily overlap. A life can be meaningful and complex and still feel emotionally empty.</p>
<p>I’d used meaning as a substitute for care. As long as my sense made sense of paper, I told myself it didn’t matter how it felt. But feelings, like bodies, keep their own accounts. Ignored long enough, they return as irritability, distance, resentment; a quiet thinning of presence.</p>
<p>I don’t have a formula for happiness. I don’t believe it can be acquired, but I don’t believe it should be ignored. What I believe now is that happiness arises from conditions, and these conditions are easily eroded without care.</p>
<p>Some days I feel fine. Some days I don’t. Still, I tend to body and soul, knowing it may lead nowhere. The mistake wasn’t in the caring, but expecting it to deliver something in return. Occasionally, happiness arrives. When it does, I try not to interrogate it. I hold it close when it’s here, and try not to hold on when it leaves.</p>
<p>One evening, I watch my son dance – one foot swinging in front of the other, hands raised, unsteady and intent, a smile on his face.</p>

			 <p>In Kyoto, the light was failing me, or maybe it was the other way around.</p>
<p>It was day six of my assignment, and I had nothing. I’d walked the old capital for hours, camera in hand, trying to capture the spirit of old Japan. I’d shot hundreds of frames – rickshaws, temples, autumn trees – but all of them felt lifeless. I kept pressing the shutter anyway, hoping to salvage the day.</p>
<p>The critic in my head grew louder with each missed shot: <em>Who do you think you are? They actually paid you to come here? You’re going to disappoint everyone.</em></p>
<p>It was my first travel photography assignment, something I’d dreamt of doing for years. But now the images I’d imagined making were turning into a different kind of story: me coming home with insipid photos, my sponsors furious, my credibility dissolving.</p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn’t have tried at all.</p>
<p>I’d always been someone who’d stayed close to what I was already good at. Things that came easily, that let me feel smart from the start. Growing up, I’d absorbed the idea that talent was a birthright: you either had it or you didn’t.</p>
<p>You were a math person, a creative person, a musical person – or not. I was afraid to try new things, because trying meant failing, and failing meant proving what I feared most: that I didn’t have it in me.</p>
<p>Psychologist Carol Dweck calls this the “fixed mindset”: a belief that abilities are fixed and failure sets one’s boundaries. But she also describes something else: the “growth mindset”, the idea that abilities can be expanded and failure isn’t a verdict, but a lesson.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure if I believed it. But photography became my experiment.</p>
<p>At the beginning, it seemed to confirm that I was, indeed, hopelessly untalented. My photos came back from the printer blurry, underexposed, and boring.</p>
<p>But I kept going. I devoured books, took courses, wandered through galleries. I remember struggling with getting sharp images – how holding the camera, setting the right shutter speed and aperture felt like juggling with glass. When I finally nailed it, I read with delight that you could use motion blur, too, to tell a different kind of story.</p>
<p>And yet, that evening in Kyoto, with nothing to show for the day, the voice of doubt returned. The sun was setting. My feet hurt, and I was growing hungry. Perhaps it was time I called it quits.</p>
<p>Then I noticed something. I’d been shooting the rickshaw drivers all day, but the daylight had flattened the images. Now, with the sun setting and the lanterns glowing, there was contrast. Maybe this was my chance.</p>
<p>I set up near a backdrop I’d scouted earlier and waited.</p>
<p>The first rickshaw passed, and I pressed the shutter. It was close, but the passengers wore a suit and a dress. It didn’t evoke the old-world feeling I was after. Then another rickshaw came into view. The passengers were in traditional kimonos. The light was almost gone. It would soon be too dark for the camera to capture anything.</p>
<p>They came closer.</p>
<p>I raised the camera and snapped.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The resulting photo was grainy and slightly blurry. But it felt alive – it had the right combination of subject, movement and colour. I stared at the preview screen, my hands trembling slightly. The day hadn’t been wasted after all. I packed up and walked into the night for dinner, stomach growling, heart stilled.</p>
<p>When I returned home, the article I eventually published, “In search of old Japan”, won an online photography award. That shot became my favourite photo from the trip.</p>
<p>But the award wasn’t the real victory. What stayed with me was the feeling of having stayed through the failure, through the critic in my head, through the long day of uncertainty. It gave me the confidence to take on more work I wasn’t sure I could do, including a second travel assignment. But more than that, it reminded me that learning is something you do, even when things are falling apart.</p>
<p>I still don’t know if everything is learnable. I doubt I’ll ever be an expert mathematician or more than a passable cook. But I know what becomes possible when I act like it might be. And sometimes that’s enough light to go by.</p>

<p>The morning skies over Tokyo were clear when I boarded the train. But by the time I stepped out, they had turned grey.</p>
<p>The rain began softly. I hesitated. I had no umbrella, and the path ahead to Meiji Shrine held no cover. Perhaps I should turn back and stay dry? If I got wet it would ruin my plans for the day. But I didn’t know when I’d be back this way again – so I stepped into it.</p>
<p>By the time I passed beneath the wooden gate, it was pouring. Water blurred my vision, turning the world into a dream. I reached the main hall, clapped twice, pressed my palms together and gave thanks – thanks for being there, far from home, soaked in the rain.</p>
<p>For the first twenty-something years of my life, travel was a distant luxury I couldn’t afford. I grew up in Singapore, my world mapped within familiar streets and repetitive schedules. I longed to see something different.</p>
<p>When I finally began to travel, I treated each trip like a precious jewel: I scripted every hour and every step, no room for weather or whimsy. I thought certainty was the way to keep disappointment at bay.</p>
<p>But plans dissolve. Trains run late. Storms arrive uninvited. Buddhist nun Pema Chödrön calls this “groundlessness” – the basic fact that nothing is solid or guaranteed beneath our feet. Change is the only constant, and we add suffering onto it when we resist change. So I learned to listen to the shifting roads and hold my itinerary loosely; not just to sightsee, but to explore.</p>
<p>On a Japanese mountainside, an elderly man pressed a warm cup of tea into my hands, while the rain drummed on the roof. In the forests of Thailand, an unexpected road trip to a temple, where a monk’s relic lay, half bone and half crystal. In the English countryside, where I spent a sleepless night in an eerie room, as portraits of the dead gazed at me beside a view to the cemetery.</p>
<p>These moments were never on the schedule.</p>
<p>I’d be lying if I said I was cured of control. I still prefer clear skies, trains that come on time, and the kind of surprises I already like. There are storms I wouldn’t risk, and days I wish I’d planned better. But groundlessness has taught me there’s no escaping uncertainty. I’ve learnt – am still learning – to walk in the rain.</p>
<p>That morning in Tokyo, I left the shrine and went for breakfast, my clothes clinging to me, my hair a mess, my socks squishing in my shoes. The waitress gave me a curious smile. I grinned back. Outside, the rain kept falling.</p>

			 <p>My heart no longer lives inside my chest. It jumps into puddles, bumbles through playgrounds, and falls asleep on my knee. It runs around corners I don’t see and goes places I can’t follow.</p>
<p>This, I’ve learned, is what it means to be a parent: to watch your most fragile joy live outside of you, in a world you cannot control.</p>
<p>I’ve never loved this wide and this deep – until the two of you. You taught me what it means to love without conditions, without end. To love someone no matter what, no matter when.</p>
<p>With love comes its shadow: worry.</p>
<p>I watch my heart cross busy roads, sweat from fever, fall and sob so hard their faces turn red. I worry about the obvious things – sickness, accidents, growing pains – and the harder ones – climate change, AI, war.</p>
<p>If I could, I would guarantee you both long, healthy and happy lives. I would make the world kind, fair and forgiving. But I can’t. Nobody escapes life alive, after all.</p>
<p>But I didn’t bring you into the world because it was safe. It never has been.</p>
<p>My parents lived through Singapore’s uncertain independence and the cold threat of nuclear annihilation. Their parents had to survive World War II and the occupation. And their parents fled war over treacherous seas on unsafe ships. It goes on and on; parents watching their hearts stumble through fire and ice and storm.</p>
<p>Still, they chose love. And hope. Because life has always held both darkness and light. Grief and joy. Worry and wonder. <a href="https://alvinsoon.com/2025/07/28/rhythms-and-ruptures.html">If the future is unpredictable</a>, it could just as well turn out better rather than worse.</p>
<p>So I, your natural-born pessimist of a father, chose hope, too. Is there a better option?</p>
<p>My only regret is meeting both of you so late. I wish we could have had more time together. But I’m grateful for all the joy and wonder you’ve already brought into our lives.</p>
<p>My heart no longer lives inside my chest; it lives on in two beautiful people I’d trade my life to protect. Take care of yourself and each other. <a href="https://alvinsoon.com/2025/05/13/be-kind-and-keep-striving.html">Be kind and keep striving</a>.</p>
<p>And remember – wherever you are, whatever happens, wherever you go, my heart is always with you.</p>

			 <p>In 2020, the world stopped. One weekday, I drove through Singapore’s central business district and saw something I’d never seen before: the streets, empty. I could have parked in the middle of five lanes and had a picnic. I couldn’t understand what was happening.</p>
<p>That’s when I turned to history.</p>
<p>I hated the subject in school. History was boring and seemed irrelevant – plus, the teacher made us stand throughout class if we failed our tests. I’m bad at memorising dates, so I stood often! I dropped the subject at the first chance.</p>
<p>But reading about past pandemics helped me make sense of the present one: people panicked, denied, blamed – just like we were doing. They also adapted, cared, rebuilt. History wasn’t dead and dated anymore – it became a living guide.</p>
<p>But if human nature was following familiar patterns, events were happening that had never happened before<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Who would have guessed that a virus would trigger a cryptocurrency bubble? Or that companies would migrate to work by video call? Or that a vaccine would be developed faster than anyone thought possible?</p>
<p>History, I realised, is a story told by a mad poet. It both rhymes <em>and</em> ruptures.</p>
<p>I’ve always craved certainty. I believed knowledge was armour: if I could only know what was coming, I’d be ready. But past events only look inevitable because of hindsight. To those living in them, the future was always unpredictable.</p>
<p>So now I try to prepare for range, not precision. We used to keep just enough food in the kitchen. When the lockdown hit, we almost ran out of things to eat. Now we stock more than we need.</p>
<p>I save more. I challenge my assumptions. Not for the next pandemic, but to be less unprepared for what can’t be predicted.</p>
<p>I still can’t remember dates. But when the poet writes another rhyme or surprises us with a rupture, I’ll know to pack a little extra water, have my people with me, and hold the lessons of history closely&hellip; if a little loosely.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>At the top of the hill above the village of Yama-no-kawa, where mists gathered like forgotten dreams, lived the monk Makoto.</p>
<p>In his austere hut, Makoto lived a life of silence and litany. Each morning, he sat in stillness. Each afternoon, he cut the air with precise martial forms. At night, he wrote. His calligraphy was collected in the capital, though no one could look at the brushstrokes for too long.</p>
<p>Honed by years of training, Makoto was beautiful – the way a garden in winter is beautiful – except for a scar beneath his left eye, which he said was <em>karma</em> from a previous life.</p>
<p>Few came to see him. He did not ask why.</p>
<h3 id="a-visitor-the-smell-of-burnt-paper">A visitor the smell of burnt paper</h3>
<p>One evening, as autumn turned leaves into faded gold, a stranger arrived. She smelled faintly of burnt paper. Her eyes, narrow and sharp, swept over Makoto as if searching for an answer.</p>
<p>They drank tea. They spoke little.</p>
<p>When the last cup was emptied, the stranger seemed to have made a choice. She rose to leave and said, “Beyond the far north, there is a temple the colour of ash. Those who spend a night emerge enlightened. Or mad.”</p>
<p>That night, Makoto sat watching the stars. When morning came, he packed his robes, his staff and a single bowl. He shut his door, then walked out of the life he’d perfected.</p>
<h3 id="winters-of-deep-longing">Winters of deep longing</h3>
<p>Makoto walked deep into the north. He crossed valleys where the trees cast no shadows. He met a boy with his eyes, who asked, “Why did you leave?”, before vanishing in a snowstorm. Makoto regretted not asking the child’s name.</p>
<p>Once, he took shelter from the rain in an opulent house that stood alone. An old woman there told him, “You have already passed the temple.” In the morning, he woke amongst ruins.</p>
<p>In time, he forgot how many winters had passed. He forgot the sound of his voice. And then the sound of his name. One day, in a forest where no birds sang, he found the temple.</p>
<h3 id="night-of-dreams-and-nightmares">Night of dreams and nightmares</h3>
<p>The temple was not just the colour of ash, it was <em>made</em> of what remained after. Ash, regret, sorrow, a cradle never filled, a question never asked, a promise never made. Fused into pillars, joints and awnings to build an unearthly memorial.</p>
<p>The main hall was darker than midnight. Makoto sat down and lit a single candle. His breath came short and uneven. It felt like the temple itself was breathing. Watching its intruder. Weighing down on him.</p>
<p>Night fell. The silence grew thick like a snake coiling itself around Makoto.</p>
<p>Somewhere, the sound of a boy laughing.</p>
<p>Then, footsteps. Heavy. Slow. Bare.</p>
<p>The doors opened.</p>
<p>A figure stepped in, stooped with age. His robes were torn, his face lined with worries, his eyes like hot coals. A scar marked his left eye, identical, in the same place to Makoto’s.</p>
<p>Makoto gasped – he <em>knew</em>. “You are me.”</p>
<p>The figure spoke. “I am what you buried. You sought the solace of silence. I chose the songs of the village. You sought the pureness of solitude. I chose the chaos of love. You held your own hands in meditation. I held a child with one hand while praying with the other.”</p>
<p>Makoto trembled, “You are caught in the world.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the figure. “Caught. And cracked open.”</p>
<p>Makoto stumbled to his feet. He took a step back. But his own gaze held him in place.</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>Makoto whispered, “What do I lack?”</p>
<p>The figure stepped close. He placed a hand on Makoto’s chest. Makoto felt something break. But not his bones. Something deeper.</p>
<p>The figure replied, “You made a perfect life. I made a true one.”</p>
<p>The candle went out.</p>
<h3 id="chopping-wood-carrying-water">Chopping wood, carrying water</h3>
<p>Some said Makoto the monk went mad that night.</p>
<p>He returned to Yama-no-kawa, but never again to his hut. He slept where he was welcomed. He ate what was offered. He spent his days doing what was needed: mending roofs, tilling the fields, washing wounds, taking care of the old, and playing with the young.</p>
<p>When asked if he still meditated, he would reply, “Chopping wood, carrying water.”</p>
<p>Others said he had become enlightened.</p>
<p>A few whispered he never left the temple. They pointed to his robes, which had turned the colour of ash.</p>

			 <p>On a moonless night in the port city of Singa, an old merchant summoned his three sons. He was dying, but he had one last secret to tell.</p>
<p>The merchant lay in his bed, skin sallow, breath shallow, clutching a locked box to his chest. Though it was plain wood and tarnished brass, his sons had never seen it open.</p>
<p>With shaking fingers, he unlocked the box.</p>
<p>It revealed an old, leathery parchment, stiff, marked with indecipherable symbols. The smell of roses filled the room. <em>Nothing more than a piece of paper?</em> his sons wondered.</p>
<p>But their father’s eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>“When I was younger than you,” he whispered, “I found this treasure map, hidden in a broken stupa, in the ruins of Nengalor. I never told anyone, not even your mother.”</p>
<p>His sons were surprised: the ruins were forbidden. But even if they weren’t, the ghosts weren’t exactly welcoming.</p>
<p>“I meant to go,” he said. “But then came trade, and children, and war, and… other wome—things. I leave the map to you now. Do with it as you will.”</p>
<p>“But father,” the first son blurted out, “If you’ve never gone looking for the treasure, how do you know it exists?”</p>
<p>“But son,” their father replied with a smile, “if you don’t go looking, how do you know it doesn’t?”</p>
<p>And with that, he passed away.</p>
<h3 id="the-doubtless">The Doubtless</h3>
<p>The first son, Yi, never leapt before looking and sometimes didn’t leap at all.</p>
<p>He bought the <em>Doubtless</em> – a majestic ship, polished to a sheen. He hired the finest navigator and the most renowned weather-seer in Singa. They studied the map for weeks, consulting obscure texts and old charts for clues.</p>
<p><em>Doubtless</em> was ready, but Yi refused to cast off until his navigator could guarantee the treasure’s coordinates, and the weather-seer could promise good weather on the voyage.</p>
<p>Neither could do either, so the first son waited. And waited. And waited.</p>
<p>The crew eventually left him. The ship grew barnacles. And Yi kept waiting.</p>
<h3 id="the-fearless">The Fearless</h3>
<p>The second son, Er, was a combination of haste and bluster. He grew impatient with his brother, made a copy of the map and hired the <em>Fearless</em>.</p>
<p><em>Fearless</em> was lithe, angular, and looked like it was moving even when it was standing still. But the ship was still recovering from its last run, its lifeboats cracked, its crew ragged.</p>
<p>Er ignored his crew’s requests to replenish the ship – he couldn’t wait to lay his hands on treasure. <em>Fearless</em> sliced off into the waves, travelling light and fast.</p>
<p>He overruled the quartermaster’s plea to restock at the next port, pointing to the cloudy horizon and saying something about his <em>destiny</em>.</p>
<p>Destiny responded with a storm.</p>
<p>Lightning split the mast. The hull groaned and split in half. The crew went down beneath the raging waves.</p>
<p>Er survived by clinging to driftwood, alongside two sailors. They washed ashore on a desert island, where they spent seven miserable days and nights before being rescued.</p>
<p>Er returned home and never set sail again.</p>
<h3 id="the-artful">The Artful</h3>
<p>The third son, San, waited longer than he liked, then watched his brothers fail exactly as he feared.</p>
<p>He engaged the <em>Artful</em>, an ageing patchwork of a ship that had mismatched sails and uneven repairs. His navigator was half-blind. His weather-seer was half-mad. They wouldn’t make promises, but San shrugged and said, “Let’s find out.”</p>
<p>He stocked more food than needed and helped refit the lifeboats himself. When all seemed ready, he tacked a charm to the hull and set off with his father’s map.</p>
<p><em>Artful</em> got lost more than once. They dodged woolly octopi the size of small islands in the Midnight Sea. They narrowly escaped the cannibal shamans of the Southern Tribes. San nearly threw himself into the Phantom Reef, lured by mournful lullabies that sang to him in his mother’s voice.</p>
<p>At one point, San almost tossed the map overboard. But the smell of roses bloomed throughout the ship. He kept going.</p>
<p>They never found the treasure.</p>
<p>But they found the lost island of Surrusus, where the stars spun backwards. They found the crystal mountain at the top of the world, shining in the night. And once, when they were lost at sea, they glimpsed a wreck of <em>Artful</em> in the fog and dared not get close.</p>
<p>They made friends. They made enemies. They buried their dead. They <em>became</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-way-home">The way home</h3>
<p>San returned home with grey in his beard. Yi barely recognised him. Er flinched at the smell of the sea. All embraced the other tightly.</p>
<p>San returned the aged map to the plain box and locked it. The scent of roses filled the air, stronger than ever. He smiled. He placed the box on a shelf, low enough for the children to see, but high enough that they couldn’t reach. Perhaps one day…</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>Somewhere in the city of Singa, a box clicked open. A breeze stirred. And a small girl whispered, “What’s that smell?”</p>

			 <p>It was dark when we rushed to the hospital. The waiting room was ice, and your hands were ice, and my insides were frost. Tears flowed like a stream down your face, from an eye that wouldn’t close. Half your face wasn’t moving.</p>
<p>We didn’t know what was happening. I tried to give you warmth I didn’t feel. “Let’s go somewhere when you get better,” I said. “Let’s go to New Zealand.” You’d dreamed of going, but Aotearoa had always been out of reach. <em>Someday</em>, I’d thought. But how many more somedays would we have?</p>
<p>It was Bell’s Palsy, a condition that causes facial paralysis. It has no known cause, no known cure. Just time. It took you six months to recover. When you finally smiled with both sides of your face, I thought we were done, and I locked my promise away.</p>
<p><em>I’m being practical</em>, I thought. The little money we’d saved was a safe we’d built against uncertainty.</p>
<p>(Where do deferred dreams go when we bury them under <em>maybes</em> and <em>somedays</em>? I imagined a quiet room at the end of my life, filled with unopened boxes named <em>later</em>. What would I find if I looked inside?)</p>
<p>“You promised,” you reminded me. I didn’t say no, but I didn’t say yes. “You promised,” you whispered. “I know,” I did the math and kept quiet. “You promised,” you said, not with anger, but like somebody who’d waited in a room longer than she should have.</p>
<p>So I bought the tickets. The locks cracked. The numbers broke.</p>
<p>The first town in New Zealand was grey, dusty and drab. Fog between the mountains, hiding the peaks. I sat in the motel, wondering if we should have come.</p>
<p>But then we drove deeper into the country and the fog began to lift. We drank from cold rivers. We rested in the deep valleys. We walked amongst ancient trees. Somewhere between the mountains, fear began to loosen its grip.</p>
<p>One afternoon, the sun set a field ablaze with golden light. You sang to me and I was brought back to life. Your hair was aflame and your eyes were aflame and your voice was a flame.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What had I been afraid of? What was the cost of a locked life? What had I understood in the hospital room that I’d forgotten?</p>
<p>I thought your eye wouldn’t shut, but it was mine that refused to open. I thought I’d promised you a visit to the land of the long white cloud, but I was really promising to not let fear speak louder than love. I thought New Zealand was the gift. But the truth is: you were the gift all along.</p>

			 <p>It was supposed to be easy. I’d been training for years: drills, sparring, conditioning. He’d just started. This would be a light match.</p>
<p>But a glancing blow hit like a hammer to my ribs. My knees buckled. I couldn’t move. My friends stopped the match before it’d barely begun. My face burned, but not from the pain.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to lose. It’s another to lose to someone who shouldn’t beat you. At sixteen, I believed effort guaranteed results. But the equation broke that day.</p>
<p>“You need skill and luck in a fight,” my <em>sensei</em> taught me later. “The more you have of one, the less you need of the other.” At the time, I thought he was talking about fighting. Now I understand he was talking about everything.</p>
<p>I’d thought of hard work as armour. Kneeling there on the floor, I glimpsed a break in that belief. Meritocracy promises fairness, but the word was originally meant as warning. In theory, it rewards effort. In practice, it forgets that there are things beyond our control.</p>
<p>Some people become cruel, believing that failure proves weakness. Others become bitter, convinced that effort is a lie. A few find something deeper: they marry striving with kindness<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. They learn to decouple failure from blame and success from superiority, because success is not always proof, and failure is not always fault.</p>
<p>I used to think the loss was my failure. Now I see it was my teacher. When I could breathe again, I stood and walked off the mat. The next day, I went back to training.</p>

<p>The bell rings before the birds remember to sing. I step outside my hut and greet the moon, my jacket around me like a shield. It is too thin against the biting wind.</p>
<p>In the distance, the silhouette of Wat Pa Don Hai Soke. I am not at home in the forests of northeast Thailand, but this temple has made a home in me. I walk the gravel path to the meditation hall, stones crunching like the bones of pilgrims.</p>
<p>There are nine more days of a simple schedule: 12 hours of meditation, one meal before noon, silence at all times. No devices, no books, no writing. The trees still like silent sentries. <em>Perhaps I was mad to come here,</em> I think. But my heart had become an open wound and was bleeding sorrow onto the ones I loved.</p>
<p>The word ‘retreat’ has two meanings. The first is to withdraw as a result of defeat. It is the breaking of armies, the gnashing of hope. The second means sanctuary. It is the victory of the spirit, the healing of hurts. I’d arrived unsure which was waiting for me.</p>
<p>A long time ago, Siddhartha Gautama sat under a fig tree in Bodh Gaya, India and entered meditation. Now six years into his search, he vowed not to stand again until he found enlightenment. His nemesis, the arch-demon Mara, mounted a war elephant and held a thousand weapons on a thousand arms. He attacked Gautama with rocks, swords, spears, arrows, fireballs and javelins. Each time, Gautama transformed them into flowers.</p>
<p>When the sun rose, Siddhartha Gautama was no more. Only the Buddha – “the awakened one” – remained. He had reached the end of suffering.</p>
<p>I have practiced for 20 years and still know nothing. Stillness feels, at first, like prison. My body complains: it was built for softer living. My mind protests: it was built for faster moving.</p>
<p>Each day repeats: I wake in the dark. I sit. I walk. I sit again. I feed the mind nothing but breath and silence and aching bones. At first, it rages. It snaps its teeth. It chews the ropes. Later, it slumps. Then, sometimes, it listens. I do not run (<em>I want to</em>). I do not howl (<em>I howl inside</em>). I stay, the way the trees stay when the wind comes. Somewhere, between one breath and the next, I begin to disappear. <em>Perhaps I am not mad after all</em>, I think.</p>
<p>On the last day, I vow not to move again until an hour of meditation is complete. Pain arrives like a thousand arrows – shoulder burning, legs cramping, back trembling. Every minute a kingdom lost. It takes everything I have to remain still.</p>
<p>And then I realise I have nothing left. I cannot win. I give up hope. <em>I am breaking,</em> I think. <em>Let me break.</em> No retreat. Full surrender. And in that abandonment, I fall through myself and find only breath. Breath and the bright nothing beyond.</p>
<p>Outside, the songs of birds. The bell rings. My eyes open, I look at my watch and laugh. I have gone past the hour. I have gone past myself.</p>
<p>When the sun rises, I leave the temple. I hesitate at the threshold – I had come to love the quiet. But I hadn’t come here simply for myself. I came to retreat so I could return. So I could transform arrows into flowers.</p>
<p>The path beneath my feet, guiding me home, until I leave my names behind.</p>
<h2 id="afterword">Afterword</h2>
<p>This essay was reconstructed from one I wrote in 2016 about my fourth visit to Wat Pa Don Hai Soke. I left fully expecting to return, I didn’t expect that I would never see its abbot again. I want to thank Venerable Ajahn Sa-ard for his kindness and generosity; I shall always remember the secret he gave me when we first met.</p>

			 <p>I hadn’t expected to walk into a cemetery. One afternoon in Tokyo, I put aside my map and followed a tree-lined path away from the noise.</p>
<p>A young family picnicked among graves, gentle laughter echoing across silent tombstones. At the end of the street stood a cafe with red awnings. I sat outside and drank a velvety hot chocolate, heart warmed by the sun.</p>
<p>But the road less travelled isn’t always sweet. In Incheon, I chased ceramics for a photography project, only to find shuttered workshops, dust settling in the air like disappointment. I waited for a bus, whose arrival was as inscrutable as the village map.</p>
<p>So I understand the appeal of the well-trodden road. A favourite store, an everyday bowl of noodles, a dog-eared book – these are waypoints that never disappoint. Sometimes, after a long day, I just want to sink into well-known comforts.</p>
<p>And even the familiar can still contain secrets. Reading a book for the tenth time uncovers an overlooked sentence. Returning to a dish I’ve eaten for years reveals a new aroma. If discovery is finding what we didn’t expect, deepening is finding anew in the expected.</p>
<p>Sometimes we stray and sometimes we stay. One path invites surprise, the other, depth. But either can fail to open us if we’re not paying attention. Ultimately, it’s not the movement that matters, but the place within where attention meets presence. Whether we’re truly there, wherever “there” is.</p>
<p>The map to wonder is always with us, waiting to unfold.</p>

			 <p>Before he became a legend, Bruce Lee was a brash young man willing to fight for what he believed in.</p>
<p>When he opened his gung-fu school in Oakland, that belief was put to the test. The local Chinese martial arts community, locked in tradition, gave him an ultimatum: stop teaching non-Chinese or fight for the right to continue.</p>
<p>It was 1964. America had just passed the Civil Rights Act – legally ending segregation, but not erasing it. Even within Lee’s culture, the walls around knowledge remained high.</p>
<p>Lee chose to tear them down. The fight lasted three minutes. He won, but he didn’t feel victorious.</p>
<p><em>It should have taken one minute</em>, Lee thought. Something in his training had failed him. His techniques, honed in the rigidity of classical forms, had limited him.</p>
<p>That’s when Bruce Lee, already a teacher, became a student again.</p>
<p>Four decades later, I wrestled with the same question: <em>can I start over?</em></p>
<p>I’d earned my black belt – 10 years in a historic martial art. I knew how to roll, how to throw a human being, how to break bones. But I also knew that none of it worked when I needed it most.</p>
<p>And so I let it go.</p>
<p>I entered a combatives school, one that trained law enforcement and military. I was armed with nothing but questions and doubt. My old beliefs resisted. My ego took a bruising. I was unlearning my old ways, but in the arena, something truer was stirring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few.”
&ndash; Shunryu Suzuki, <em>Zen Mind, Beginner&rsquo;s Mind</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lee called this a process of continuing growth. Not a style. Not a crystallisation. But a way of honestly questioning and expressing oneself.</p>
<p>He began anew by breaking down his preconceptions. Lee learnt without limits, blending fencing, boxing, Wing Chun, and new and old training methods. Not to create a new style but to dismantle them.</p>
<p>Out of that exploration came Jeet Kune Do – ‘the way of the intercepting fist’, a way of fighting, but also a way of seeing. The JKD symbol declares: “Having no way as way. Having no limitation as limitation.”</p>
<p>In the movie <em>Way of the Dragon</em>, Lee fights Chuck Norris in a Roman colosseum. At first, Norris has the upper hand. Lee takes a beating, then adapts. He bends, feints, switches rhythm. Norris stays rigid and loses.</p>
<p>Bruce Lee died at 32, still evolving. He’s remembered as a master, but maybe what made him great was his willingness to be a student.</p>

			 <p>It was a bright, busy Saturday morning. We wandered through the mall, our son darting ahead, and our daughter nestled in our arms. As we walked into the LEGO store, their eyes lit up. They always loved playing with the loose bricks near the front.</p>
<p>I’d held off on buying a set since our son was born. He’d been too small for the tiny bricks. But now he was nearing three, and I thought maybe – just maybe – we could build something together. I chose a sleek maroon starfighter. Even if we fumbled through it, it’d be a fun way to spend the afternoon.</p>
<p>Just a few hours later, I was lying beneath fluorescent lights in the Intensive Care Unit. My heart had been racing above 150 beats per minute for over an hour. It wasn’t slowing down.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what was happening or if this seemingly ordinary day would become my last. I wasn’t afraid of dying. But I was terrified I’d never see my children grow up.</p>
<p>I texted my wife from the hospital bed: <em>I’ve always wanted to tell our children I’d love them, no matter what.</em> They were too young to understand it now. But if I couldn’t be there to say it myself, I hoped the message would find its way to them someday.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the spike in my heart rhythm was treatable and not life-threatening. I was discharged a day later, fazed but grateful.</p>
<p>A week passed.</p>
<p>And then, on another ordinary Saturday, my son and I built the starfighter.</p>
<p>I handled the instructions and nudged the bricks into place. He sat beside me, snapping on bits and pieces. He was restless, as any toddler would be, but every time I asked if he wanted to stop, he said no. He wanted to keep going. So did I.</p>
<p>Now the finished starfighter sits on a shelf in the living room, pointed towards the window, catching sunlight on its wings. Outside, the birds are singing. Inside, I hear the two of you laughing.</p>
