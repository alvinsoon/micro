			 <p>The morning skies over Tokyo were clear when I boarded the train. But by the time I stepped out, they had turned grey.</p>
<p>The rain began softly. I hesitated. I had no umbrella, and the path ahead to Meiji Shrine held no cover. Perhaps I should turn back and stay dry? If I got wet it would ruin my plans for the day. But I didn’t know when I’d be back this way again – so I stepped into it.</p>
<p>By the time I passed beneath the wooden gate, it was pouring. Water blurred my vision, turning the world into a dream. I reached the main hall, clapped twice, pressed my palms together and gave thanks – thanks for being there, far from home, soaked in the rain.</p>
<p>For the first twenty-something years of my life, travel was a distant luxury I couldn’t afford. I grew up in Singapore, my world mapped within familiar streets and repetitive schedules. I longed to see something different.</p>
<p>When I finally began to travel, I treated each trip like a precious jewel: I scripted every hour and every step, no room for weather or whimsy. I thought certainty was the way to keep disappointment at bay.</p>
<p>But plans dissolve. Trains run late. Storms arrive uninvited. So I learned to listen to the road and hold my itinerary loosely; not just to sightsee, but to explore.</p>
<p>On a Japanese mountainside, an elderly man pressed a warm cup of tea into my hands, while the rain drummed on the roof. In the forests of Thailand, an unexpected road trip to a temple, where a monk’s relic lay, half bone and half crystal. In the English countryside, where I spent a sleepless night in an eerie room, as portraits of the dead gazed at me beside a view to the cemetery next door.</p>
<p>These moments were never on the schedule.</p>
<p>I’d be lying if I said I was cured of control. I still prefer clear skies, trains that come on time, and the kind of surprises I already like. There are storms I wouldn’t risk, and days I wish I’d planned better. But I’ve learnt – am still learning – to walk in the rain.</p>
<p>That morning in Tokyo, I left the shrine and went for breakfast, my clothes clinging to me, my hair a mess, my socks squishing in my shoes. The waitress gave me a strange smile. I smiled back. Outside, the rain kept falling.</p>

			 <p>My heart no longer lives inside my chest. It jumps into puddles, bumbles through playgrounds, and falls asleep on my knee. It runs around corners I don’t see and goes places I can’t follow.</p>
<p>This, I’ve learned, is what it means to be a parent: to watch your most fragile joy live outside of you, in a world you cannot control.</p>
<p>I’ve never loved this wide and this deep – until the two of you. You taught me what it means to love without conditions, without end. To love someone no matter what, no matter when.</p>
<p>With love comes its shadow: worry.</p>
<p>I watch my heart cross busy roads, sweat from fever, fall and sob so hard their faces turn red. I worry about the obvious things – sickness, accidents, growing pains – and the harder ones – climate change, AI, war.</p>
<p>If I could, I would guarantee you both long, healthy and happy lives. I would make the world kind, fair and forgiving. But I can’t. Nobody escapes life alive, after all.</p>
<p>But I didn’t bring you into the world because it was safe. It never has been.</p>
<p>My parents lived through Singapore’s uncertain independence and the cold threat of nuclear annihilation. Their parents had to survive World War II and the occupation. And their parents fled war over treacherous seas on unsafe ships. It goes on and on; parents watching their hearts stumble through fire and ice and storm.</p>
<p>Still, they chose love. And hope. Because life has always held both darkness and light. Grief and joy. Worry and wonder. <a href="https://alvinsoon.com/2025/07/28/rhythms-and-ruptures.html">If the future is unpredictable</a>, it could just as well turn out better rather than worse.</p>
<p>So I, your natural-born pessimist of a father, chose hope, too. Is there a better option?</p>
<p>My only regret is meeting both of you so late. I wish we could have had more time together. But I’m grateful for all the joy and wonder you’ve brought into our lives.</p>
<p>My heart no longer lives inside my chest; it lives on in two beautiful people I’d trade my life to protect. Take care of yourself and each other. <a href="https://alvinsoon.com/2025/05/13/be-kind-and-keep-striving.html">Be kind and keep striving</a>.</p>
<p>And remember – wherever you are, whatever happens, wherever you go, my heart is always with you.</p>

			 <p>In 2020, the world stopped. One weekday, I drove through Singapore’s central business district and saw something I’d never seen before: the streets, empty. I could have parked in the middle of five lanes and had a picnic. I couldn’t understand what was happening.</p>
<p>That’s when I turned to history.</p>
<p>I hated the subject in school. History was boring and seemed irrelevant – plus, the teacher made us stand throughout class if we failed our tests. I’m bad at memorising dates, so I stood often! I dropped the subject at the first chance.</p>
<p>But reading about past pandemics helped me make sense of the present one: people panicked, denied, blamed – just like we were doing. They also adapted, cared, rebuilt. History wasn’t dead and dated anymore – it became a living guide.</p>
<p>But if human nature was following familiar patterns, events were happening that had never happened before<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Who would have guessed that a virus would trigger a cryptocurrency bubble? Or that companies would migrate to work by video call? Or that a vaccine would be developed faster than anyone thought possible?</p>
<p>History, I realised, is a story told by a mad poet. It both rhymes <em>and</em> ruptures.</p>
<p>I’ve always craved certainty. I believed knowledge was armour: if I could only know what was coming, I’d be ready. But past events only look inevitable because of hindsight. To those living in them, the future was always unpredictable.</p>
<p>So now I try to prepare for range, not precision. We used to keep just enough food in the kitchen. When the lockdown hit, we almost ran out of things to eat. Now we stock more than we need.</p>
<p>I save more. I challenge my assumptions. Not for the next pandemic, but to be less unprepared for what can’t be predicted.</p>
<p>I still can’t remember dates. But when the poet writes another rhyme or surprises us with a rupture, I’ll know to pack a little extra water, have my people with me, and hold the lessons of history closely&hellip; if a little loosely.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>At the top of the hill above the village of Yama-no-kawa, where mists gathered like forgotten dreams, lived the monk Makoto.</p>
<p>In his austere hut, Makoto lived a life of silence and litany. Each morning, he sat in stillness. Each afternoon, he cut the air with precise martial forms. At night, he wrote. His calligraphy was collected in the capital, though no one could look at the brushstrokes for too long.</p>
<p>Honed by years of training, Makoto was beautiful – the way a garden in winter is beautiful – except for a scar beneath his left eye, which he said was <em>karma</em> from a previous life.</p>
<p>Few came to see him. He did not ask why.</p>
<h3 id="a-visitor-the-smell-of-burnt-paper">A visitor the smell of burnt paper</h3>
<p>One evening, as autumn turned leaves into faded gold, a stranger arrived. She smelled faintly of burnt paper. Her eyes, narrow and sharp, swept over Makoto as if searching for an answer.</p>
<p>They drank tea. They spoke little.</p>
<p>When the last cup was emptied, the stranger seemed to have made a choice. She rose to leave and said, “Beyond the far north, there is a temple the colour of ash. Those who spend a night emerge enlightened. Or mad.”</p>
<p>That night, Makoto sat watching the stars. When morning came, he packed his robes, his staff and a single bowl. He shut his door, then walked out of the life he’d perfected.</p>
<h3 id="winters-of-deep-longing">Winters of deep longing</h3>
<p>Makoto walked deep into the north. He crossed valleys where the trees cast no shadows. He met a boy with his eyes, who asked, “Why did you leave?”, before vanishing in a snowstorm. Makoto regretted not asking the child’s name.</p>
<p>Once, he took shelter from the rain in an opulent house that stood alone. An old woman there told him, “You have already passed the temple.” In the morning, he woke amongst ruins.</p>
<p>In time, he forgot how many winters had passed. He forgot the sound of his voice. And then the sound of his name. One day, in a forest where no birds sang, he found the temple.</p>
<h3 id="night-of-dreams-and-nightmares">Night of dreams and nightmares</h3>
<p>The temple was not just the colour of ash, it was <em>made</em> of what remained after. Ash, regret, sorrow, a cradle never filled, a question never asked, a promise never made. Fused into pillars, joints and awnings to build an unearthly memorial.</p>
<p>The main hall was darker than midnight. Makoto sat down and lit a single candle. His breath came short and uneven. It felt like the temple itself was breathing. Watching its intruder. Weighing down on him.</p>
<p>Night fell. The silence grew thick like a snake coiling itself around Makoto.</p>
<p>Somewhere, the sound of a boy laughing.</p>
<p>Then, footsteps. Heavy. Slow. Bare.</p>
<p>The doors opened.</p>
<p>A figure stepped in, stooped with age. His robes were torn, his face lined with worries, his eyes like hot coals. A scar marked his left eye, identical, in the same place to Makoto’s.</p>
<p>Makoto gasped – he <em>knew</em>. “You are me.”</p>
<p>The figure spoke. “I am what you buried. You sought the solace of silence. I chose the songs of the village. You sought the pureness of solitude. I chose the chaos of love. You held your own hands in meditation. I held a child with one hand while praying with the other.”</p>
<p>Makoto trembled, “You are caught in the world.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the figure. “Caught. And cracked open.”</p>
<p>Makoto stumbled to his feet. He took a step back. But his own gaze held him in place.</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>Makoto whispered, “What do I lack?”</p>
<p>The figure stepped close. He placed a hand on Makoto’s chest. Makoto felt something break. But not his bones. Something deeper.</p>
<p>The figure replied, “You made a perfect life. I made a true one.”</p>
<p>The candle went out.</p>
<h3 id="chopping-wood-carrying-water">Chopping wood, carrying water</h3>
<p>Some said Makoto the monk went mad that night.</p>
<p>He returned to Yama-no-kawa, but never again to his hut. He slept where he was welcomed. He ate what was offered. He spent his days doing what was needed: mending roofs, tilling the fields, washing wounds, taking care of the old, and playing with the young.</p>
<p>When asked if he still meditated, he would reply, “Chopping wood, carrying water.”</p>
<p>Others said he had become enlightened.</p>
<p>A few whispered he never left the temple. They pointed to his robes, which had turned the colour of ash.</p>

			 <p>On a moonless night in the port city of Singa, an old merchant summoned his three sons. He was dying, but he had one last secret to tell.</p>
<p>The merchant lay in his bed, skin sallow, breath shallow, clutching a locked box to his chest. Though it was plain wood and tarnished brass, his sons had never seen it open.</p>
<p>With shaking fingers, he unlocked the box.</p>
<p>It revealed an old, leathery parchment, stiff, marked with indecipherable symbols. The smell of roses filled the room. <em>Nothing more than a piece of paper?</em> his sons wondered.</p>
<p>But their father’s eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>“When I was younger than you,” he whispered, “I found this treasure map, hidden in a broken stupa, in the ruins of Nengalor. I never told anyone, not even your mother.”</p>
<p>His sons were surprised: the ruins were forbidden. But even if they weren’t, the ghosts weren’t exactly welcoming.</p>
<p>“I meant to go,” he said. “But then came trade, and children, and war, and… other wome—things. I leave the map to you now. Do with it as you will.”</p>
<p>“But father,” the first son blurted out, “If you’ve never gone looking for the treasure, how do you know it exists?”</p>
<p>“But son,” their father replied with a smile, “if you don’t go looking, how do you know it doesn’t?”</p>
<p>And with that, he passed away.</p>
<h3 id="the-doubtless">The Doubtless</h3>
<p>The first son, Yi, never leapt before looking and sometimes didn’t leap at all.</p>
<p>He bought the <em>Doubtless</em> – a majestic ship, polished to a sheen. He hired the finest navigator and the most renowned weather-seer in Singa. They studied the map for weeks, consulting obscure texts and old charts for clues.</p>
<p><em>Doubtless</em> was ready, but Yi refused to cast off until his navigator could guarantee the treasure’s coordinates, and the weather-seer could promise good weather on the voyage.</p>
<p>Neither could do either, so the first son waited. And waited. And waited.</p>
<p>The crew eventually left him. The ship grew barnacles. And Yi kept waiting.</p>
<h3 id="the-fearless">The Fearless</h3>
<p>The second son, Er, was a combination of haste and bluster. He grew impatient with his brother, made a copy of the map and hired the <em>Fearless</em>.</p>
<p><em>Fearless</em> was lithe, angular, and looked like it was moving even when it was standing still. But the ship was still recovering from its last run, its lifeboats cracked, its crew ragged.</p>
<p>Er ignored his crew’s requests to replenish the ship – he couldn’t wait to lay his hands on treasure. <em>Fearless</em> sliced off into the waves, travelling light and fast.</p>
<p>He overruled the quartermaster’s plea to restock at the next port, pointing to the horizon and saying something about his <em>destiny</em>.</p>
<p>Destiny responded with a storm.</p>
<p>Lightning split the mast. The hull groaned and split in half. The crew went down beneath the raging waves.</p>
<p>Er survived by clinging to driftwood, alongside two sailors. They washed ashore on a desert island, where they spent seven miserable days and nights before being rescued.</p>
<p>Er returned home and never set sail again.</p>
<h3 id="the-artful">The Artful</h3>
<p>The third son, San, waited longer than he liked, then watched his brothers fail exactly as he feared.</p>
<p>He engaged the <em>Artful</em>, an ageing patchwork of a ship that had mismatched sails and uneven repairs. His navigator was half-blind. His weather-seer was half-mad. They wouldn’t make promises, but San shrugged and said, “Let’s find out.”</p>
<p>He stocked more food than needed and helped refit the lifeboats himself. When all seemed ready, he tacked a charm to the hull and set off with his father’s map.</p>
<p><em>Artful</em> got lost more than once. They dodged woolly octopi the size of small islands in the Midnight Sea. They narrowly escaped the cannibal shamans of the Southern Tribes. San nearly threw himself into the Phantom Reef, lured by mournful lullabies that sang to him in his mother’s voice.</p>
<p>At one point, San almost tossed the map overboard. But the smell of roses bloomed throughout the ship. He kept going.</p>
<p>They never found the treasure.</p>
<p>But they found the lost island of Surrusus, where the stars spun backwards. They found the crystal mountain at the top of the world, shining in the night. And once, when they were lost at sea, they glimpsed a wreck of <em>Artful</em> in the fog and dared not get close.</p>
<p>They made friends. They made enemies. They buried their dead. They <em>became</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-way-home">The way home</h3>
<p>San returned home with grey in his beard. Yi barely recognised him. Er flinched at the smell of the sea. All embraced the other tightly.</p>
<p>San returned the aged map to the plain box and locked it. The scent of roses filled the air, stronger than ever. He smiled. He placed the box on a shelf, low enough for the children to see, but high enough that they couldn’t reach. Perhaps one day…</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>Somewhere in the city of Singa, a box clicked open. A breeze stirred. And a small girl whispered, “What’s that smell?”</p>

			 <p>It was supposed to be easy. I’d been training for years: drills, sparring, conditioning. He’d just started. This would be a light match.</p>
<p>But a glancing blow hit like a hammer to my ribs. My knees buckled. I couldn’t move. My friends stopped the match before it’d barely begun. My face burned, but not from the pain.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to lose. It’s another to lose to someone who shouldn’t beat you. At sixteen, I believed effort guaranteed results. But the equation broke that day.</p>
<p>“You need skill and luck in a fight,” my <em>sensei</em> taught me later. “The more you have of one, the less you need of the other.” At the time, I thought he was talking about fighting. Now I understand he was talking about everything.</p>
<p>I’d thought of hard work as armour. Kneeling there on the floor, I glimpsed a break in that belief. Meritocracy promises fairness, but the word was originally meant as warning. In theory, it rewards effort. In practice, it forgets that there are things beyond our control.</p>
<p>Some people become cruel, believing that failure proves weakness. Others become bitter, convinced that effort is a lie. A few find something deeper: they marry striving with kindness<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. They learn to decouple failure from blame and success from superiority, because success is not always proof, and failure is not always fault.</p>
<p>I used to think the loss was my failure. Now I see it was my teacher. When I could breathe again, I stood, bowed to my opponent and walked off the mat. The next day, I went back to training.</p>
