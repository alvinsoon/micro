			 <p>It was dark when we rushed to the hospital. The waiting room was ice, and your hands were ice, and my insides were frost. Tears flowed like a stream down your face, from an eye that wouldn’t close. Half your face wasn’t moving.</p>
<p>We didn’t know what was happening. I tried to give you warmth I didn’t feel. “Let’s go somewhere when you get better,” I said. “Let’s go to New Zealand.” You’d dreamed of going, but Aotearoa had always been out of reach. <em>Someday</em>, I’d thought. But how many more somedays would we have?</p>
<p>It was Bell’s Palsy, a condition that causes facial paralysis. It has no known cause, no known cure. Just time. It took you six months to recover. When you finally smiled with both sides of your face, I thought we were done, and I locked my promise away.</p>
<p><em>I’m being practical</em>, I thought. The little money we’d saved was a safe we’d built against uncertainty.</p>
<p>(Where do deferred dreams go when we bury them under <em>maybes</em> and <em>somedays</em>? I imagined a quiet room at the end of my life, filled with unopened boxes named <em>later</em>. What would I find if I looked inside?)</p>
<p>“You promised,” you reminded me. I didn’t say no, but I didn’t say yes. “You promised,” you whispered. “I know,” I did the math and kept quiet. “You promised,” you said, not with anger, but like somebody who’d waited in a room longer than she should have.</p>
<p>So I bought the tickets. The locks cracked. The numbers broke.</p>
<p>The first town in New Zealand was grey, dusty and drab. Fog between the mountains, hiding the peaks. I sat in the motel, wondering if we should have come.</p>
<p>But then we drove deeper into the country and the fog began to lift. We drank from cold rivers. We rested in the deep valleys. We walked amongst ancient trees. Somewhere between the mountains, fear began to loosen its grip.</p>
<p>One afternoon, the sun set a field ablaze with golden light. You sang to me and I was brought back to life. Your hair was aflame and your eyes were aflame and your voice was a flame.</p>
<p>What had I been afraid of? What was the cost of a locked life? What had I understood in the hospital room that I’d forgotten?</p>
<p>I thought your eye wouldn’t shut, but it was mine that refused to open. I thought I’d promised you a visit to the land of the long white cloud, but what I was really promising was to not let fear speak louder than love. I thought New Zealand was the gift. But the truth is: you were the gift all along.</p>

			 <p>It was supposed to be easy. I’d been training for years: drills, sparring, conditioning. He’d just started. This would be a light match.</p>
<p>But a glancing blow hit like a hammer to my ribs. My knees buckled. I couldn’t move. My friends stopped the match before it’d barely begun. My face burned, but not from the pain.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to lose. It’s another to lose to someone who shouldn’t beat you. At sixteen, I believed effort guaranteed results. But the equation broke that day.</p>
<p>“You need skill and luck in a fight,” my <em>sensei</em> taught me later. “The more you have of one, the less you need of the other.” At the time, I thought he was talking about fighting. Now I understand he was talking about living.</p>
<p>I’d thought of hard work as armour. Kneeling there on the floor, I glimpsed a break in that belief. Meritocracy promises fairness, but the word was originally meant as warning. In theory, it rewards effort. In practice, it forgets that there are things beyond our control.</p>
<p>Some people become cruel, believing that failure proves weakness. Others become bitter, convinced that effort is a lie. A few find something deeper: they marry striving with kindness<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. They learn to decouple failure from blame and success from superiority, because success is not always proof, and failure is not always fault.</p>
<p>I used to think the loss was my failure. Now I see it was my teacher. When I could breathe again, I stood, bowed to my opponent and walked off the mat. The next day, I went back to training.</p>

<p>The bell rings before the birds remember to sing. I step outside my hut and greet the moon, my jacket around me like a shield. It is too thin against the biting wind.</p>
<p>In the distance, the silhouette of Wat Pa Don Hai Soke. I am not at home in the forests of northeast Thailand, but this temple has made a home in me. I walk the gravel path to the meditation hall, stones crunching like the bones of pilgrims.</p>
<p>There are nine more days of a simple schedule: 12 hours of meditation, one meal before noon, silence at all times. No devices, no books, no writing. The trees still like silent sentries. <em>Perhaps I was mad to come here,</em> I think. But my heart had become an open wound and was bleeding sorrow onto the ones I loved.</p>
<p>The word ‘retreat’ has two meanings. The first is to withdraw as a result of defeat. It is the breaking of armies, the gnashing of hope. The second means sanctuary. It is the victory of the spirit, the healing of hurts. I’d arrived unsure which was waiting for me.</p>
<p>A long time ago, Siddhartha Gautama sat under a fig tree in Bodh Gaya, India and entered meditation. Now six years into his search, he vowed not to stand again until he found enlightenment. His nemesis, the arch-demon Mara, mounted a war elephant and held a thousand weapons on a thousand arms. He attacked Gautama with rocks, swords, spears, arrows, fireballs and javelins. Each time, Gautama transformed them into flowers.</p>
<p>When the sun rose, Siddhartha Gautama was no more. Only the Buddha – “the awakened one” – remained. He had reached the end of suffering.</p>
<p>I have practiced for 20 years and still know nothing. Stillness feels, at first, like prison. My body complains: it was built for softer living. My mind protests: it was built for faster moving.</p>
<p>Each day repeats: I wake in the dark. I sit. I walk. I sit again. I feed the mind nothing but breath and silence and aching bones. At first, it rages. It snaps its teeth. It chews the ropes. Later, it slumps. Then, sometimes, it listens. I do not run (<em>I want to</em>). I do not howl (<em>except inside</em>). I stay, the way the trees stay when the wind comes. Somewhere, between one breath and the next, I begin to disappear. <em>Perhaps I am not mad after all</em>, I think.</p>
<p>On the last day, I vow not to move again until an hour of meditation is complete. Pain arrives like a thousand arrows – shoulder burning, legs cramping, back trembling. Every minute a kingdom lost. It takes everything I have to remain still.</p>
<p>And then I realise I have nothing left. I cannot win. I give up hope. <em>I am breaking,</em> I think. <em>Let me break.</em> No retreat. Full surrender. And in that abandonment, I fall through myself and find only breath. Breath and the bright nothing beyond.</p>
<p>Outside, the songs of birds. The bell rings. My eyes open, I look at my watch and laugh. I have gone past the hour. I have gone past myself.</p>
<p>When the sun rises, I leave the temple. I hesitate at the threshold – I had come to love the quiet. But I hadn’t come here simply for myself. I came to retreat so I could return. So I could transform arrows into flowers.</p>
<p>The path beneath my feet, guiding me home, until I leave my names behind.</p>
<h2 id="afterword">Afterword</h2>
<p>This essay was reconstructed from one I wrote in 2016 about my fourth visit to Wat Pa Don Hai Soke. I left fully expecting to return, I didn’t expect that I would never see its abbot again. I want to thank Venerable Ajahn Sa-ard for his kindness and generosity; I shall always remember the secret he gave me when we first met.</p>

			 <p>I hadn’t expected to walk into a cemetery. One afternoon in Tokyo, I put aside my map and followed a tree-lined path away from the noise.</p>
<p>A young family picnicked among graves, gentle laughter echoing across silent tombstones. At the end of the street stood a cafe with red awnings. I sat outside and drank a velvety hot chocolate, heart warmed by the sun.</p>
<p>But the road less travelled isn’t always sweet. In Incheon, I chased ceramics for a photography project, only to find shuttered workshops, dust settling in the air like disappointment. I waited for a bus, whose arrival was as inscrutable as the village map.</p>
<p>So I understand the appeal of the well-trodden road. A favourite store, an everyday bowl of noodles, a dog-eared book – these are waypoints that never disappoint. Sometimes, after a long day, I want to sink into well-known comforts.</p>
<p>Even the familiar can still contain secrets. Reading a book for the tenth time uncovers an overlooked sentence. Returning to a dish I’ve eaten for years reveals a new aroma. If discovery is finding what we didn’t expect, deepening is finding anew in the expected.</p>
<p>Sometimes we stray and sometimes we stay. One path invites surprise, the other, depth. But either can fail to open us if we’re not paying attention. Ultimately, it’s not the movement that matters, but the place within where attention meets presence. Whether we’re truly there, wherever “there” is.</p>
<p>The map to wonder lies in the space between presence and absence.</p>

			 <p>Before he became a legend, Bruce Lee was a brash young man willing to fight for what he believed.</p>
<p>When he opened his gung-fu school in Oakland, that belief was put to the test. The local Chinese martial arts community, locked in tradition, gave him an ultimatum: stop teaching non-Chinese or fight for the right to continue.</p>
<p>It was 1964. America had just passed the Civil Rights Act – legally ending segregation, but not erasing it. Even within Lee’s culture, the walls around knowledge remained high.</p>
<p>Lee chose to tear them down. The fight lasted three minutes. He won, but he didn’t feel victorious.</p>
<p><em>It should have taken one minute</em>, Lee thought. Something in his training had failed him. His techniques, honed in the rigidity of classical forms, had limited him.</p>
<p>That’s when Bruce Lee, already a teacher, became a student again.</p>
<p>Four decades later, I wrestled with the same question: <em>can I start over?</em></p>
<p>I’d earned my black belt – 10 years in a historic martial art. I knew how to roll, how to throw a human being, how to break bones. But I also knew that none of it worked when I needed it most.</p>
<p>And so I let it go.</p>
<p>I entered a combatives school, one that trained law enforcement and military. I was armed with nothing but questions and doubt. My old beliefs resisted. My ego took a bruising. I was unlearning my old ways, but in the arena, something truer was stirring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few.”
&ndash; Shunryu Suzuki, <em>Zen Mind, Beginner&rsquo;s Mind</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lee called this a process of continuing growth. Not a style. Not a crystallisation. But a way of honestly questioning and expressing oneself.</p>
<p>He began anew by breaking down his preconceptions. Lee learnt without limits, blending fencing, boxing, Wing Chun, and new and old training methods. Not to create a new style but to dismantle them.</p>
<p>Out of that exploration came Jeet Kune Do – ‘the way of the intercepting fist’, a way of fighting, but also a way of seeing. The JKD symbol declares: “Having no way as way. Having no limitation as limitation.”</p>
<p>In the movie <em>Way of the Dragon</em>, Lee fights Chuck Norris in a Roman colosseum. At first, Norris has the upper hand. Lee takes a beating, then adapts. He bends, feints, switches rhythm. Norris stays rigid and loses.</p>
<p>Bruce Lee died at 32, still evolving. He’s remembered as a master, but maybe what made him great was his willingness to be a student.</p>

			 <p>It was a bright, busy Saturday morning. We wandered through the mall, our son darting ahead, and our daughter nestled in our arms. As we walked into the LEGO store, their eyes lit up. They always loved playing with the loose bricks near the front.</p>
<p>I’d held off on buying a set since our son was born. He’d been too small for the tiny bricks. But now he was nearing three, and I thought maybe – just maybe – we could build something together. I chose a sleek maroon starfighter. Even if we fumbled through it, it’d be a fun way to spend the afternoon.</p>
<p>Just a few hours later, I was lying beneath fluorescent lights in the Intensive Care Unit. My heart had been racing above 150 beats per minute for over an hour. It wasn’t slowing down.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what was happening – if this seemingly ordinary day would become my last. It wasn’t dying that scared me. It was the possibility that I might never see our children grow up.</p>
<p>I texted my wife from the hospital bed: <em>I’ve always wanted to tell our children I’d love them, no matter what.</em> They were too young to understand it now. But if I couldn’t be there to say it myself, I hoped the message would find its way to them someday.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the spike in my heart rhythm was treatable and not life-threatening. I was discharged a day later, fazed but grateful.</p>
<p>A week passed.</p>
<p>And then, on another ordinary Saturday, my son and I built the starfighter.</p>
<p>I handled the instructions and nudged the bricks into place. He sat beside me, snapping on bits and pieces. He was restless, as any toddler would be, but every time I asked if he wanted to stop, he said no. He wanted to keep going. So did I.</p>
<p>Now the finished starfighter sits on a shelf in the living room, pointed towards the window, catching sunlight on its wings. Outside, the birds are singing. Inside, I hear the two of you laughing.</p>
